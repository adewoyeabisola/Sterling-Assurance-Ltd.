• Retention rate is 74.6% while attrition rate is 25.4%.

• Attrition by Tenure analysis shows that the most exit was from employees within a tenure of 0-4years.

• The Age group with the most exit is 50-59years old, this could be due to retirement or could be that most of them only stayed for a short period as established in the tenure analysis.

• 48% of the exit were females, 41% were male and 10% were categorized as other gender.

• For the department analysis, 18.8% of the exit was from the sales department, 18.1% where from the HR department. This could be due to target, work pressure and difficulty in implementing HR policies.

• It was also noted that about 39.5% of employees require improvement in the completion of training assigned to employees, as the analysis shows that they did not attain the required number of trainings to be done.

• The risk level distribution showed that 76.01% of employees were categorized as high risk, which meant that they are more likely to leave the organization for different reasons. Only 0.94% employees were categorized as low risk which shows that a significant number of employees might still exit the organization.

# ✅ Recommendation


• **Hiring** - A thorough analysis should be done to check the age group of employees at the point of hiring themOnboarding should also be checked due to the tenure years of most exited employees.

• **Training** - The Training Modules should be check to be sure they are not ambiguous as a lot of employees are not participating in the training.Also, trainings should be channelled to suit roles and functions.

• **Compensation and Benefits** - Despite the fact that salary might not be a contributory factor to attrition, the company might need to focus on benefits especially vacation days and taking breaks at work, to ensure a sustainable work life balance. Pressure at work could be a significant factor to consider.

• **Employee Engagement** - The company should develop different engagement programs to help employees unwind and feel more at ease. Team building activities to ease tension, also helping employees relate together outside of the work place.
